This song can explain my point of view as a girl who is deeply aware of her flaws and negative traits and is trying to change those things because she also hates these negative traits that she has, although these flaws or red flags only appear because of the traumas that she experienced before. Somehow after all of these negative traits, flaws, and red flags, she is still wishing someone could see right through her, read her, and understand the reasons why she is like this. After everything, even after knowing all those negative traits, she hopes someone will stay.

    help me hold unto you"
   "who could every leave me darling?
     but who could stay?"
    "and i cut off my nose just to spite my face
       then hate my reflection for years and years"
     "can you see right through me?"
